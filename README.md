# Cardboard_Old_QR_To_New
The Google Cardboard App was unable to scan a former generation of QR-Codes on VR headsets.
This changed now, so the "software" is useless.

> Enter the URL which is contained in the QRCode that the Cardboard App doesn't accept
("goo.gl/...", including "http(s)", but not "www")

I was too lazy to do some checks there ;)
